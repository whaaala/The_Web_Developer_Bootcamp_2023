Sessions 
  This are similar to idea of cookies in the sense that we are trying to add in some statefulness to HTTP (HTTP is a stateless Protocol)
  We are trying to SAVE or SHARE some information between one HTTP request to the next

  Sessions
     Are on the Server side 
      The actual DATA  itself is stored on the server side
    
    Why not cookies instead of Sessions
     cookies have a maximum size 
       there is a number of cookies you can have per domain and the size of each cookie
     Cookies are not as secure as storing information on the server side

     The idea of a session is that we store information on the server side
      And a little cookie is sent back to the client that provides information to unlock the session
