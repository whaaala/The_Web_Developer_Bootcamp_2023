The whole point of using mongoose is to have an easier way to interact with a mongDB database from JavaScript

And the way that the interaction is done in mongoose is the Model


Models 
   Are JavaScript classes that are made with the assistance of mongoose
     that represent information in a mongDB database (specifically a Model represents information in some collection)

    Model methods --> https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/model.html
  
  To define a model 
     A Schema needs to be created 
       An example: 
          const kittySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
                 name: String
           });
