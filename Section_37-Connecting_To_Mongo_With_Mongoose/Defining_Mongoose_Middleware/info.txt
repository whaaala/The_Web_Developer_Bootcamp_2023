middleware --> https://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html

mongoose gives you the ability to run code before and after certain mongoose operation are executed (certain methods are called)

  there is .pre --> this will run before the method called will be executed
                 example: 
                        mainSchema.pre('findOneAndUpdate', function() {
                            console.log('Middleware on parent document'); // Will be executed
                        });
                        
  there is .post --> this will run after the method called is executed
                 example: 
                        schema.post('save', function(doc) {
                            console.log('%s has been saved', doc._id);
                        });
