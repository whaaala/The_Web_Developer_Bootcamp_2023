Method-override --> http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/method-override.html


HTML Form can ONLY SEND A POST request OR A GET request, Therefore it is an issue to send a PUT request OR A PATCH request with an HTML Form 
  
   Hence while MethodOverride is used to fake the PUT request and the PATCH request in an HTML Form
