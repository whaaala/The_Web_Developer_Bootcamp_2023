Passwords Salting or Hash Salts
 Salting is an extra step that is done (or taken) when hashing a password to make it harder to reverse engineer

 The way it used is when a user's pasword needs be hashed 
    a RANDOM value will be added to the password before the password is hashed (that random value is called salt) 
    this helps to ensure unique hashes and mitigate common attacks
