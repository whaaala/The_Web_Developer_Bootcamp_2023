How Passwords are stored 
 RULE #1 
  NEVER STORE PASSWORDS in text (never store the passwords as is, in the database)

  HASHING
   Instade of storing the password as is, HASH the password 
    the password as is, is ran through something called: hashing function first and then the result of the hashing is then stored in the database

    WHAT IS A HASHING FUNCTION
     Hashing functions are functions that map input data of some arbitrary size to fixed-size output values

      A hashing function always has to give the same value for one input (everytime the same value is input the output value as to be the same also)
