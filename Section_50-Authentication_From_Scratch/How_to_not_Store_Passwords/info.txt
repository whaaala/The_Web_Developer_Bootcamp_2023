HASHING FUNCTION
  Hashing functions are groups of functions of different types and uses

  Cryptographic Hash functions
   this is used for password Hashing because of this:
    
    1. One-way function which is infeasibe to invert (it cannot be reversed)
    2. Small change in inpute yields large change in the output
    3. Deterministic - same input yields same output 
    4. Unlikely to find 2 outputs with same value
    5. Password Hash functions are deliberately SLOW
