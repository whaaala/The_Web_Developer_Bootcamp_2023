With a generic form a file input can be put in the form 
 but the file information will not be sent properly, if you are using a default HTML form 
  And this is because of the encoding type attribute on a form with is: 
     application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   and to upload files with a form the encoding type attribute needs to be set to: 
     multipart/form-data

            enctype
            If the value of the method attribute is post, enctype is the MIME type of the form submission. Possible values:

                application/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value.

                multipart/form-data: Use this if the form contains <input> elements with type=file.

                text/plain: Useful for debugging purposes.

            This value can be overridden by formenctype attributes on <button>, <input type="submit">, or <input type="image"> elements.
  
  In other to parse multipart form data, a middleware needs to be used (There are many parser middleware out there)
    Multer middleware
       this can be used to parse multipart form data --> https://github.com/expressjs/multer
         Use: 
         upload.single('<value of name attribute of the form>') to allow a single file to be uploaded
         upload.array('<value of name attribute of the form>') to allow a multiple files to be uploaded

 this is used to store images and video files 


dotenv  --> https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv
 This is a file that is used to store information that you DO NOT WANT TO SHARE with other people or sent to github
  this file is typically named: .env
   the . makes it a hidden file

SETTING UP .env file
  create a file in the root of the project and calle: .env
    then define Key Value pairs info in the file
    then install a packge called: dotenv
    and then use the package to access any Key Value pairs info from the: .env file
    then in your main .js file (in this case app.js) write this:
          if(process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"){
            require('dotenv').config(); 
          }
        process.env.NODE_ENV is an environment variable that is usually development or production 
      
      this conditon will check if the environment been used is not production and if NOT
       then it will add the variables defined in the .env file and add them into the process.env in the NODE APP 
         so they can be accessible in any file within the project 
        
    the way to access the Key value pair is to use: process.env.<Key name>
          
            THIS IS NOT DONE THIS WAY IN PRODUCTION
