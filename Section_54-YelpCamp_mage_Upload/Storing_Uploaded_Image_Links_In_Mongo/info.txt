Multer-storage-cloudinary --> https://github.com/affanshahid/multer-storage-cloudinary
 this works with multer and cloudinary 
  it helps to make it smooth to use files that multer is parseing to cloudinary

 it also works so when you recieve the url back from cloudinary, multer add them into your project 
  so that you can have access to the route handling callbacks

  Packages to Install
    npm i cloudinary 
    npm i multer-storage-cloudinary

  Create a folder for cloudinary
   and create a index.js file in the cloudinary folder
    and require the packages needed 

  Useage: 
      const cloudinary = require('cloudinary').v2;
      const { CloudinaryStorage } = require('multer-storage-cloudinary');
      const express = require('express');
      const multer = require('multer');

      const app = express();

      const storage = new CloudinaryStorage({
        cloudinary: cloudinary,
        params: {
          folder: 'some-folder-name',
          format: async (req, file) => 'png', // supports promises as well
          public_id: (req, file) => 'computed-filename-using-request',
        },
      });

      const parser = multer({ storage: storage });

      app.post('/upload', parser.single('image'), function (req, res) {
        res.json(req.file);
      });
